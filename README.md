# Photo recognition in odoo using TensorFlow

This module recognize the photos you upload.



This want to be the first step towards integrating a Deep Learning System into an ERP
With this example I would like to demonstrate the potential of integrating a deeplearnig system with an ERP.
From this example you can see how machine learning recognizes an input image.

The next steps I want to integrate are:
1) Possibility to give the machine new results for the photos. So basically, teach the machine.

2) Connect the learning machine result with actions in ERP. For example, if the machine recognizes a customer request then opens a new listing.
